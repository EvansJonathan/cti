Functionality could exist within remote access tools to enable this, but utilities available on the operating system could also be used. Adversaries may also use local host files in order to discover the hostname to IP address mappings of remote systems. \n\n### Windows\n\nExamples of tools and commands that acquire this information include \"ping\" or \"net view\" using [Net](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0039). The contents of the <code>C:\\Windows\\System32\\Drivers\\etc\\hosts</code> file can be viewed to gain insight into the existing hostname to IP mappings on the system.\n\n### Mac\n\nSpecific to Mac, the <code>bonjour</code> protocol to discover additional Mac-based systems within the same broadcast domain. Utilities such as \"ping\" and others can be used to gather information about remote systems. The contents of the <code>/etc/hosts</code> file can be viewed to gain insight into existing hostname to IP mappings on the system.\n\n### Linux\n\nUtilities such as \"ping\" and others can be used to gather information about remote systems.
