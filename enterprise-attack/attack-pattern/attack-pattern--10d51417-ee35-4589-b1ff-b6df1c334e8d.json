There are often remote service gateways that manage connections and credential authentication for these services.

(Citation: Volexity Virtual Private Keylogging) Access to [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) to use the service is often a requirement, which could be obtained through credential pharming or by obtaining the credentials from users after compromising the enterprise network.
