It creates a multi-hop proxy network and utilizes multilayer encryption to protect both the message and routing information. [Tor](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0183) utilizes \"Onion Routing,\" in which messages are encrypted with multiple layers of encryption; at each step in the proxy network, the topmost layer is decrypted and the contents forwarded on to the next node until it reaches its destination.
