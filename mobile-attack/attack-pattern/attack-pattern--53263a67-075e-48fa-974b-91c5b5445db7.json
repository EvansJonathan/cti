            "description": "Malicious applications are a common attack vector used by adversaries to gain a presence on mobile devices. This technique describes installing a malicious application on targeted mobile devices without involving an authorized app store (e.g., Google Play Store or Apple App Store). Adversaries may wish to avoid placing malicious applications in an authorized app store due to increased potential risk of detection or other reasons. However, mobile devices often are configured to allow application installation only from an authorized app store which would prevent this technique from working.\n\nDelivery methods for the malicious application include:\n\n* [Spearphishing Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1193) - Including the mobile app package as an attachment to an email message.\n* [Spearphishing Link](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1192) - Including a link to the mobile app package within an email, text message (e.g. SMS, iMessage, Hangouts, WhatsApp, etc.), web site, QR code, or other means.\n* Third-Party App Store - Installed from a third-party app store (as opposed to an authorized app store that the device implicitly trusts as part of its default behavior), which may not apply the same level of scrutiny to apps as applied by an authorized app store.(Citation: IBTimes-ThirdParty)(Citation: TrendMicro-RootingMalware)(Citation: TrendMicro-FlappyBird)\n\nAs a prerequisite, adversaries may use this PRE-ATT&CK technique:\n\n* [Obtain Apple iOS enterprise distribution key pair and certificate](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1392)",
